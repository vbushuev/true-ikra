Pizzaland is a child theme of the Twenty Fifteen default WordPress theme.  This ensures that it's got a solid basis on which it's built.  It's specifically designed for restaurants and cafes.  However, it can be used as a blogging theme without installing any of the recommended plugins.  To use as a blog, make sure you have a copy of the Twenty Fifteen theme in your WordPress installation, download Pizzaland from WordPress.org themes repository or from the WordPress Themes Admin panel, and activate it. 

Pizzaland comes to its own when the following plugins are installed and activated: 

- Food and Drink Menu Plugin:

by NateWr (http://themeofthecrop.com)

- Restaurant Reservations Plugin:

- Testimonials Widget plugin:
https://wordpress.org/plugins/testimonials-widget/
by Michael Cannon and saurabhd

- Team Members Plugin: 
https://wordpress.org/plugins/team-members/
by WP Darko 

When the Food and Drink Menu plugin and the Testimonials Widget plugin are activated, make sure you add a page as your Home page and select the Restaurant Home custom page template from the Template box in the page editor.    

Detailed tutorials on how to install and set up Pizzaland to look like the demo are available on the Theme's page: http://wpthememakeover.com/pizzaland-a-child-theme-of-twenty-fifteen-for-restaurants
