= Frequently Asked Questions =

=== When I added logo, header layout is distorted. Why? ===

You are able to add a logo of any size. However the width of the logo depends on the width of the main menu. If you got few menu items the logo could be wider.
The height of the logo governs the height of the header area. The higher the logo the higher the the area. The menu will be positioned at the bottom of the header.
